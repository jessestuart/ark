Improve `describe` output
   * Move Phase to right under Metadata(name/namespace/label/annotations)
   * Move Validation errors: section right after Phase: section and only
     show it if the item has a phase of FailedValidation
   * For restores move Warnings and Errors under Validation errors. Leave
     their display as is.
